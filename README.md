## Dataset

**CTU-Malware**. Comprising real-world university network traces, this dataset provides continuous PCAP captures rather than isolated samples. 
This continuity preserves the natural chronological order and concurrency of flows, enabling the reconstruction of temporal-topological structures in multi-flow attacks. 
We select six malware families (i.e., Dridex, Emotet, Geodo, Miuref, Zeus, and TrickBot) for D1, and use the remaining traffic for D2 to evaluate unseen malware detection.
You can download the above dataset via https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-malware.

**USTC-TFC2016**. This real-world dataset contains ten categories, each of benign and malware traffic. 
To facilitate inter-flow analysis, we utilize original timestamps and IP identifiers to re-establish session-based context, grouping logical interactions into local subgraphs. 
We construct D3 from malware and D4 from benign traffic.
D4 serves as a noisy testbed to evaluate false positives in simulated real-world network scenarios.

## Supported Environments
The project is compatible with the following operating systems and environments:

### Operating System
- Windows or Ubuntu (Linux)
### Programming Language & Version
- Python 3.10 is required.
- Must use the python3 command (ensure compatibility with modern deep learning libraries).
### Software & Libraries
